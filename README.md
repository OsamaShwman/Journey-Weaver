## ðŸš€ Getting Started

This application is designed to run directly in the browser with no build step required.

### Configuration

To enable the "Ask AI" feature, you must have a Gemini API key.

1.  Obtain a key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey).
2.  Set it as an environment variable named `API_KEY` in the execution environment where the app is served. The application code will automatically pick it up via `process.env.API_KEY`.

## ðŸ§­ How to Use

1.  **Explore the Default Tour:** When you first load the app, it presents a pre-configured tour of Jordan's most famous landmarks. Use the navigation arrows or click on map icons to explore.
2.  **Upload Your Own Tour:**
    - Click the **Upload** button (the cloud icon with an up arrow) in the bottom-left corner.
    - Select a valid JSON file from your computer that follows the format described below.
    - The map will instantly update with your custom tour, ready for you to explore!

## ðŸ“„ Custom Tour JSON Format

To create your own tour, create a `.json` file containing an array of landmark objects. The app is forgiving and will try to parse common variations in key names (e.g., `name` or `city`, `imageUrl` or `image`).

### Basic Structure

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Your Landmark Name",
    "description": "A rich description of the landmark. HTML tags like <p> and <b> are supported for formatting.",
    "coordinates": [LATITUDE, LONGITUDE],
    "imageUrl": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
    "videoUrl": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=your_video_id",
    "audioUrl": "https://example.com/audio.mp3",
    "block_navigation": false,
    "quiz": [
      {
        "question": "What year was this built?",
        "type": "multiple-choice",
        "options": [
          { "text": "1990", "isCorrect": false },
          { "text": "2005", "isCorrect": true },
          { "text": "1875", "isCorrect": false }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
